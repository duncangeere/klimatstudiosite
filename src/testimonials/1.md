quote: "Working with Duncan is an absolute pleasure. He's thoughtful, creative, organized, and truly collaborative. Duncan translated a big, complex set of data into a family of visualizations for The Drawdown Review. It's no surprise they became very popular, so we've made them available to the public as key climate communication tools. I'd jump at the chance to work with him again."

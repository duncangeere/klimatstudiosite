quote: "We've benefited from Duncan's excellent copywriting and editing skills on a range of projects at Nesta. His editing work has brought consistency and clarity to website features, including our high-performing Predictions series, and he has done a wonderful job writing copy to share our impact and learnings in our annual report. He is a pleasure to work with and I'd recommend him highly. I hope we get to do more projects together."

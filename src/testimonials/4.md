quote: "Duncan is extremely easy to work with, and handled our project with the utmost professionalism, organisation and clarity, whilst also being creative and good-humoured throughout. I was particularly impressed by his attention to detail, his grasp of the storytelling and narrative, and the ease and care with which he teased out the key elements of these to build a series of infographics that were not just brilliantly representative, but engaging, accessible and clear. We hope to continue working with him for many future projects and cannot recommend him highly enough."
